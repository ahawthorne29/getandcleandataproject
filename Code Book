Code Book for”mytidyaverages.txt”

The file contains a data frame of 81 variables and 180 observations.

The file is based on the original dataset derived from here:

30 subjects were observed each performing one of 6 activities. The various variables observed are presented, averaged per activity per subject. I.e. 30 subjects x 6 activities = 180 observation averages.


2 identifier variables:

"activity"	- factor variable of 6 activities, namely:
			 	STANDING           
				SITTING            
				LAYING             
				WALKING            
				WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 
				WALKING_UPSTAIRS
   
"subject"      - numeric variable, 1 to 30. This is an identifier for the person being observed.     

79 observation variables: 
These are all numeric and are the averages (mean) of those in the raw data, per activity and subject.

The observartions that were averaged are described as follows in the raw data:

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
